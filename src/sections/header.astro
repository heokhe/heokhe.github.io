    Previously, the gradient effect was done using a fixed background on the `p` itself.
    But it acted weird and inconsistent on mobile devices and some browsers.
    Instead, we use two fixed divs with gradient backgrounds to achieve the same effect,
    And raise everything else to a z-index of 10 to put them above the gradient.
